                <h2><a href=""> A Bite of Yummy üòã</a></h2>
                <span>By Subrina Ferdous</span>
                <p>‚ÄúYummy‚Äù is an adjective with a proper ending that was created from ‚Äúyum yum‚Äù. These two simple words, ‚Äúyum yum‚Äù, have meant ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù since the late 19th century and they are ‚Äúimitative‚Äù which means that the sounds are meant to imitate the sounds of a happy person who eats some good food and smacks his lips.</p>

                <span>By Subrina Ferdous</span>
                <p>Food that tastes delicious is flavorful. If the soup you're making is a little bland, you might want to add salt and pepper to make it more flavorful. When you eat something that's tasty and satisfying, or well-seasoned and distinctive, it's flavorful. In other words, it's full of flavor.</p>

                <span>By Subrina Ferdous</span>
                <p>Cookies should be of a uniform thickness and size so they will bake in the same amount of time. Using a small cookie scoop or ice cream scoop will provide picture-perfect, uniform size cookies. To get uniform cookies, weigh the cookie dough.</p>
